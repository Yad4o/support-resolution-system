## 7. Data Models

### 7.1 User

Purpose: Authentication and authorization.

Fields:
- id (primary key)
- email (unique)
- hashed_password
- role (user / agent / admin)

---

Purpose: Represents a customer support request.

Fields:
- id
- message
- intent
- confidence
- status
- created_at

Statuses:
- open
- auto_resolved
- escalated
- closed

---

## 9. AI & Automation Flow

### 9.1 Intent Classification

Input:
- Raw ticket message

Output:
- Intent label
- Confidence score (0.0 – 1.0)

Example:
```json
{
  "intent": "login_issue",
  "confidence": 0.82
}
```
## 9.2 Similarity Search

### Purpose

Similarity search is used to identify whether a newly created ticket
is **similar to any previously resolved ticket**.

The core idea is:
> If a problem has already been solved successfully before, reuse that solution instead of generating a new one.

This improves:
- Accuracy
- Consistency
- Response time
- Safety (known solutions are trusted)

---

### Why Similarity Search Is Needed

Intent classification alone is not sufficient.

Example:
- Ticket A: “I cannot login to my account”
- Ticket B: “Login not working since yesterday”

Both may map to `login_issue`, but the **exact resolution** might already
exist for Ticket A.

Similarity search allows:
- Reusing proven responses
- Avoiding hallucinated or incorrect AI responses
- Reducing compute cost

---

### Inputs

- **New ticket message** (raw user text)
- **List of previously resolved ticket messages**

The API layer fetches resolved tickets from the database and passes them
to the similarity service.

---

### Outputs

If a similar ticket is found:

```json
{
  "matched_text": "I cannot login to my account",
  "similarity_score": 0.81
}
```
If no suitable match is found:
```
null
```
## 9.3 Response Generation

### Purpose

Response Generation is responsible for creating the **final human-readable reply**
that is sent back to the customer after analysis is complete.

This component answers the question:

> “What should the system say to the user?”

It focuses on **clarity, correctness, and safety**, not on decision-making.

---

### Responsibilities

The response generation component is responsible for:

- Producing clear and polite responses
- Reusing previously successful solutions when available
- Generating deterministic replies for common intents
- Providing safe fallback responses when confidence is low

---

### What This Component Must NOT Do

- Decide whether a ticket should be auto-resolved
- Update ticket status in the database
- Access database sessions
- Call FastAPI endpoints

This component **only returns text**.

---

### Inputs

- **intent**  
  Predicted intent label (e.g., `login_issue`, `payment_issue`)

- **original_message**  
  Raw customer message for context

- **similar_solution (optional)**  
  A solution reused from a similar previously resolved ticket

---

### Response Priority Order

Responses are generated using the following priority:

1. **Reuse Similar Ticket Solution**  
   - Highest priority  
   - Proven to work  
   - Improves consistency and trust  

2. **Intent-Based Static Responses**  
   - Safe, deterministic templates  
   - Easy to audit and maintain  

3. **AI-Generated Responses (Future)**  
   - Used only when confidence is high  
   - Requires safeguards against hallucinations  

4. **Fallback Response**  
   - Used when intent is unknown or confidence is insufficient  

---

### Example Response

```
"It looks like you're having trouble logging in.
Please try resetting your password using the
'Forgot Password' option on the login page."
```

---

### Safety Considerations

- No assumptions beyond provided information
- No sensitive or irreversible instructions
- Conservative wording
- Encourages human escalation when uncertain

---

## 9.4 Decision Engine

### Purpose

The Decision Engine determines **whether a ticket should be handled automatically
or escalated to a human agent**.

This is the **primary safety control layer** of the system.

---

### Why Decision Logic Is Isolated

AI predictions are probabilistic and can be incorrect.

Separating decision logic:

- Prevents blind trust in AI
- Allows business-controlled thresholds
- Enables auditing and explainability
- Reduces operational risk

---

### Inputs

- **confidence score**  
  A floating-point value between `0.0` and `1.0` returned by the classifier

---

### Outputs

One of the following decisions:

- `AUTO_RESOLVE`
- `ESCALATE`

---

### Decision Rules (Initial Version)

| Confidence Score | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| ≥ 0.75 | Auto-resolve |
| < 0.75 | Escalate to human |

These thresholds are intentionally **conservative**.

---

### Validation Rules

- Confidence must be within the range `0.0 – 1.0`
- Missing or invalid confidence → **Escalate**
- Any ambiguity → **Escalate**

Safety always takes precedence over automation.

---

### Future Enhancements

- Per-intent confidence thresholds
- Feedback-driven threshold tuning
- SLA-aware decisions
- Risk-based escalation policies

---

## 9.5 End-to-End Automation Flow

### Purpose

This section explains how **all AI and decision components work together**
from ticket creation to final resolution.

It provides a complete picture of the automation pipeline.

---

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Ticket Creation**
   - User submits a support ticket
   - Ticket status is set to `OPEN`

2. **Intent Classification**
   - Raw ticket text is analyzed
   - Intent and confidence score are produced

3. **Similarity Search**
   - Past resolved tickets are searched
   - A known solution may be reused

4. **Decision Engine**
   - Confidence score is evaluated
   - Decision is made: auto-resolve or escalate

5. **Response Generation**
   - If auto-resolving:
     - Response is generated
     - Ticket status updated
   - If escalating:
     - Ticket routed to human agent

6. **Feedback Collection**
   - User provides feedback after resolution
   - Data stored for future improvement

---

### Automation Guarantees

- No auto-resolution without confidence validation
- No AI decision without explicit thresholds
- Every uncertain case is escalated
- Human agents always remain in control

---

### Key Design Principle

> Automation should assist humans, not replace them.

This flow ensures the system remains **trustworthy, auditable, and safe**.
## 10. Security Design

### Purpose

Security is a core requirement of this system because it handles:
- User credentials
- Internal system logic
- Automated decision-making

The design follows **security-by-default** principles.

---

### 10.1 Authentication

- JWT-based stateless authentication is used
- Tokens are issued only after successful login
- Each token contains:
  - User ID
  - User role
- Tokens have expiration time

Benefits:
- No server-side session storage
- Easy horizontal scaling
- Secure and industry-standard

---

### 10.2 Password Handling

- Passwords are **never stored in plain text**
- Passwords are hashed using **bcrypt**
- Verification is done via hash comparison only

At no point is the original password retrievable.

---

### 10.3 Authorization

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Admin endpoints restricted to admin users
- Regular users cannot access system metrics

Authorization checks are enforced at the API layer.

---

### 10.4 AI Safety Controls

- No auto-resolution without confidence validation
- No AI output directly changes system state
- Decision engine always acts as a gatekeeper
- Any uncertainty leads to escalation

This prevents unsafe automation.

---

## 11. Error Handling Strategy

### Purpose

The system must fail **safely and predictably**.

Errors should:
- Be understandable
- Never leak internal details
- Allow graceful recovery

---

### 11.1 Error Categories

| Error Type | HTTP Status |
|----------|------------|
| Validation Error | 400 |
| Authentication Error | 401 |
| Authorization Error | 403 |
| Resource Not Found | 404 |
| AI / Service Failure | 200 with fallback |
| Internal Server Error | 500 |

---

### 11.2 AI Failure Handling

If any AI service fails:
- Skip automated resolution
- Escalate ticket to human
- Log the failure for review

The system **never blocks users** due to AI failure.

---

### 11.3 Logging Strategy

- Errors are logged internally
- No stack traces exposed to clients
- Logs can be used for monitoring and audits

---

## 12. Configuration Management

### Purpose

Configuration must be:
- Centralized
- Environment-specific
- Secure

---

### 12.1 Environment-Based Configuration

- All secrets stored in environment variables
- `.env` file used only for development
- `.env` is never committed to GitHub

---

### 12.2 Centralized Configuration

- Managed via `config.py`
- Loaded once and cached
- Single source of truth for settings

Benefits:
- Consistency across services
- Easier debugging
- Cleaner codebase

---

## 13. Scalability Considerations

### 13.1 Short-Term Scalability

- SQLite → PostgreSQL
- Background workers for heavy tasks
- Caching frequently accessed data

---

### 13.2 Long-Term Scalability

- Vector databases (FAISS / Pinecone)
- Distributed service architecture
- Horizontal scaling of API servers
- Asynchronous processing pipelines

---

## 14. Testing Strategy

### Purpose

Testing ensures:
- Reliability
- Predictability
- Confidence in automation

---

### 14.1 Unit Testing

- Intent classification logic
- Similarity scoring
- Decision engine thresholds
- Response generation

---

### 14.2 Integration Testing

- Full ticket lifecycle
- API endpoints
- Error scenarios
- Edge cases

---

### 14.3 Mocking Strategy

- AI responses are mocked
- Deterministic test outcomes
- Threshold edge-case testing

---

## 15. Deployment Plan

### 15.1 Build Strategy

- FastAPI application is Docker-ready
- Dependencies pinned via `requirements.txt`
- Environment variables injected at runtime

---

### 15.2 CI/CD Pipeline

- GitHub Actions for:
  - Linting
  - Testing
  - Build validation
- Automatic deployment on successful checks

---

### 15.3 Hosting

- Render / Railway / AWS
- HTTPS enforced
- Environment-specific configs

---

## 16. Non-Goals

This system intentionally does NOT:
- Fully replace human support
- Automatically retrain AI models
- Make irreversible decisions
- Operate without confidence thresholds

These constraints are deliberate for safety.
